## Hardware Requirements

- PIC16F877A microcontroller
- LED
- Resistors and connecting wires

## Software Requirements

- MPLAB X IDE
- Proteus (for simulation)

## How to Run

1. Open the `led.c` file in MPLAB X IDE.
2. Build and compile the code.
3. Connect your PIC16F877A microcontroller to your development board.
4. Connect the LED to the appropriate pin on the microcontroller.
5. Load the compiled code onto the microcontroller.
6. Run the Proteus simulation using the provided connection diagram.

## Circuit Connection
